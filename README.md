#  Hey there, code explorers!

Welcome to the digital playground of Adriano Santos, a software developer who's passionate about building systems that scale and thrive.

##  About me ‍

I'm like a caffeine-powered compiler, constantly converting coffee into code. My favorite languages include:

    Java ☕️ (Can't code without my daily dose!)
    Kotlin (It's like Java's cooler, younger sibling)
    JavaScript ✨ (For those dynamic frontend adventures)
    SQL (Data whispering is my secret talent)

I'm also fluent in:

    Spring Boot (For rapid development with a side of magic)
    React ⚛️ (Bringing UI dreams to life)
    Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Kubernetes ️(The distributed systems trifecta)

##  When I'm not coding...

    You'll find me exploring new coding challenges (the mind never rests!)
    Or catching a flight to discover new cultures and horizons ✈️

##  Let's connect and collaborate!

I'm always down for a virtual coffee chat, whether it's about potential projects, tech trends, or just geeking out about code!
