## My Repository Naming Convention

To maintain consistency and make it easier to identify the purpose of each repository, I follow this naming convention:


### Structure:
- **project-name**: The main name of the project, representing its functionality.
- **type**: Defines whether the project is `backend`, `frontend`, or `mobile`.
- **technology**: Specifies the main technology used, such as `react-native-js`, `react-native-ts`, `spring-kotlin`, `react-js`, etc.
- **category**: Indicates whether it is from a **course** (e.g., `rocketseat`) or a **PoC** (`poc`).

### Examples:
| Repository | Description |
|------------|------------|
| `to-do-list__mobile__react-native-js__rocketseat` | To-Do List in React Native (JS) from a Rocketseat course. |
| `task-manager__backend__spring-kotlin__poc` | PoC of a task manager built with Spring Kotlin. |
| `github-explorer__frontend__react-js__rocketseat` | Frontend application built with React JS from a Rocketseat course. |

This convention helps maintain a clear organization and makes it easier to find projects in the future. 🚀
